## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media querries. 

### What I learned

In this problem I learned how to use media querries to make your design more responsive. It is one step ahead of using the units that scale with the screen and browser settings.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 380px) {
    .card-tag,
    .card-date {
        font-size: 1.2rem;
    }

    .card-title {
        font-size: 2rem;
    }

    .card-desc {
        font-size: 1.4rem;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

For now I dont see any way i can improve this design. If you have any improvements do let me know.
